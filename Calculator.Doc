Calculator 

In this, I going to create a calculator using javascript. 
First, create a folder on the desktop and open this folder in the vs code and create an index.html, style.css, and app.js.
Now open the index.html and link the style.css and app.js and now create a div classname calculator-grid and in it another div classname output and in it another div classname previous-operand.
after this div create another div class name current-operand.
Now I will implement all the buttons in a calculator.
For ac and = I will add the class names span-two so I will style those buttons separately.  
Now I style these html components. In style.css
First i will add the styles to the whole html page box-sizing,font-family and font-weight.
In this I will add the styles to the body is padding, margin, background color.  
In this i will style the calculator gird. Add display grid and it properties and and we apply grid columns and rows to keep it in a column.
In this i will style the calculator grid buttons i will add the cursor pointer, increase the size of the font and add some border and background color.
And i add hover it so when it hover on the buttons it will change the background color. 
In this i will style the ac and equal button i will add grid column to it. 
This is the output box i will add back ground, grid column , display flex and it properties. 
Wordwrap and word-break then the digits are in the more and it should break and goes to another line so it is used. 
In this the precious operand and current operand means the present number which are typed is called the current operand and precious operand
means the function which is add to the current operand and perciuse operand is called the precious operand
in this i will add the color to the both operand and increase the font size. 
Now I will add the functionalities to these in the app.js. In this I will import the all the class in Javascript.
In this I will add class to js so i will store the all the calculatated number in the calculator.
And this is the class of calculator.
In this I will add the click function to the number button. So if you click  on the button it will display.
In this I the same function is added to the opertionbuttons.
In this same function to the equal button.
In this i added the same function. 
In this i added the same function. 
For these all functions i will add  in the calculator class. If we press the ac button it should clear the all the number so i mentioned it in tbhe calculator class.
I add a delete function so if i click on the delete button it will remove the number in the current operand. 
In this i add the number to current operand so it will add the number to it and
I used another statement to it due to as the numbers are add the same way the dots are also adding so to stop it i used it.
In this i will add the operators so that current operand and previous operand so that will be the separate the operands.
In this I add the operations between the current and previous operaand by using the switch case methods. 
In this i will push the number in the currentoperand and previousoperand.
In this i will import the string and integerdigits and decimaldigits i used if and else statement to display the numbers.
